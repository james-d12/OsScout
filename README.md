# OsScout

OsScout is going to be a NuGet Package that provides more detailed operating system information. At the moment it aims
to support more
in-depth details about what Linux distribution you may be using. It is similar to
rust's https://crates.io/crates/os_info package.

I used the os-release files from here: https://github.com/which-distro/os-release as a starting point.
